am i the only one.
who doesn't get a text from you
am i the only one .
who doesn't get to talk to you

am i guy that bad
whom you don't even consider to talk
whom you don't even consider to walk with 

am i that bad
do i make you sad
girl am going mad 
my eyes are red
when i just go fade
would  you even care 
a little.

i still remember
when you saw me first 
you smiled at me
i don't understand 
what made it last?
am i not funnier
the way i was before,
do i make you bore
that you can't even stand 
with me..
can't you share your pain with me 

am i that bad
do i make you sad
girl am going mad 
my eyes are red
when i just go fade
would  you even care 
a little.
can you talk to me once
can you  smile again
don't hurt me like this
i can't take this pain 
my heart is brittle.
would you even care  a little

i know you had your heart broke
but give it another chance
the world is better place
out side , just have another glance
slow music in the background 
can we just have a little dance 
can i here you more
your voice is a soothing sound.

don't say no no 
don't go like this
come to me again
i might not eradicate
i know what you going through
i don't you tell me you pain.

am i that bad
do i make you sad
girl am going mad 
my eyes are red
when i just go fade
would  you even care 
a little.
can you talk to me once
can you  smile again
don't hurt me like this
i can't take this pain 
my heart is brittle.
would you even care  a little
